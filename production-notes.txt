Features Brainstorm:
    - Timer settings (interval lengths, sounds/alarms, volume, number of focus before long break, auto start next timer or not)
    - Integrated todo list
    - Calender intigration (linked w/ google calender?)
    - Pause, play, and skip forward/back
    - SHOW TIMER ON TAB NAME
   X - Schedule feature? Pre-lay out a day of work/breaks?
   - Music feature? Pause/play lo-fi style music.

Design Brainstorm:
    - Animation for timer progress
    - Color/theme settings (array of primary and secondary color options, images, gifs.)
        - Focus, Short Break, Long Break each with Primary Color, Secondary/Accent Color Options (Must work w/ white text color or figure out how to change that too)
        - Perhaps even custom uploadable background images/gifs?

To-DO:

    To get it working base level:
    - Fix timer pausing on alt tab. currently slows down marginally and so timer is off.
    X - Add timer to tab title
    (Temp fixed)- Fix breakpoints 
    - Add to-do list



    General:
    X - Add pause timer functionality.
    - Figure out HTML/CSS for pop/pull out windows: 
        -To-Do

        X -Settings. 
    - (Interchangable with next) Connect js functionality to the nav bar windows:
        - Settings: X Three time interval inputs connected to timer. Color change options. X Focus interval setter and functionality. Alarm options.
        - Menu: How to, about page, etc.
        - Make volume button mute/change volume w/ slider.
    - (Interchangable with next) Connect js functionality to pull out windows:

        - To - Do
    - Add skip functionality to the controls below the timer.
    - Fix breakpoints for smaller screen sizes.
    -Fix timer not working when on another tab (smth to do with the interval timer I think?).
